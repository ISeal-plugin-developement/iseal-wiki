<summary>Step 2: Installing it on your server</summary>

_Free hosts that we would suggest are Minehut or Minefort (Not sponsored); Aternos doesn't think it's popular enough, although this is our suggestion, you can use any host you would like :)_

Open your server's panel, head to the file manager, and then head to `~/plugins/` Then upload the plugin into there, and then **RESTART** your server.
