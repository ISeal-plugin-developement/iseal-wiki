If set to true, gems cannot be dropped by players.

### Give a gem on the first logon (`giveGemOnFirstLogin`):

If set to false, gems will not be given to players when they first log in.

### Allow fire gem to destroy blocks (`explosionDamageAllowed`):

### Prevent gem power tampering. (`preventGemPowerTampering`):

If set to true, gem abilities which can be interacted with (ex. a fireball) will not be able to be interacted with (ex. deflecting a fireball).

### Do gem decay (`doGemDecay`):

If set to true, gems will "decay" when the player dies (subtract 1 level), and they will stop decaying at level 1 unless `doDecayOnLevel1` is set to true

### Gem Decay on level 1 (`doDecayOnLevel1`):

If set to true, while `doGemDecay` is set to true, gems will not stop decaying at level 1; if gems decay at level 1, they will get destroyed.

### Dragon Egg Halves cooldown (`dragonEggHalfCooldown`):

As mentioned on the page [the-gems-and-their-ablities](../../../overview/the-gems-and-their-ablities/ "mention"), when the player has a dragon egg in their inventory, it halves their gem ability cooldown. If this is set to false, then the dragon egg will no **longer** halve the cooldown.

### Randomized Colors (`randomizedColors`):

If set to true, the plugin will be much more _<mark style="color:blue;">C</mark><mark style="color:purple;">o</mark><mark style="color:orange;">l</mark><mark style="color:red;">or</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">f</mark><mark style="color:green;">u</mark><mark style="color:blue;">l</mark>!_ The gems will spawn in random colors, making each Gem unique!

### Cooldown Boost Per Level (`cooldownBoostPerLevelInSeconds`):

The time to remove from each ability's cooldown per level.

### Delay to use gems (`delayToUseGemsOnJoin`):

Delay in seconds to wait to use gems when a player logs in.

### Gem Creation Attempts (`gemCreationAttempts`):

The number of attempts the plugins will make to avoid doubles before giving up, lower this if you are having lag on gem creation.

### Blocked Lava Blocks (`blockedLavaBlocks`):

The blocks which the lava wall ability may not overwrite, useless as of latest versions, as lava only overwrites air.

### Allow Moving Gems (`allowMovingGems`):

{% hint style="danger" %}
Currently not implemented. Raccomended to keep to false.
{% endhint %}

Allow moving gems between containers (chests, etc.)
