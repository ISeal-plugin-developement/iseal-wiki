# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PowerGems

{% hint style="warning" %}
**PowerGems isn't supposed to be a copy of Bliss SMP; the developer (ISeal) just had the same idea. The developers will not implement features only because they're "like Bliss SMP"; they will implement features they think should go into the plugin and the ones they like.**
{% endhint %}

## Overview

PowerGems is a small plugin created by ISeal. When players first join the game, they are given a random gem, each with a different power!
